# Alien-Invasion

This would be my first 'pythonian' project since the reason I want to is improving my skills.

## Requirements and installation
[PYGAME Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
Python version - 3.7.4

pygame as required (As you can type in the terminal: `python3 -m pip install --user pygame`)

If you guys see the command that doesnt work, try `python3 -m pip install pygame` without the `--user` flag

## User Stories

The player controls a rocket ship where it is at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the space-bar.
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across adn down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game over!
